# Groove

Groove is a full-stack music community platform built with Flutter (frontend, ~7,000 lines of Dart), Go (backend, ~5,000 lines of Go), and PostgreSQL. The project enables bands and artists to manage profiles, share links, and promote events, while fans can follow creators and discover local music. Groove features a modern, responsive UI, reusable Flutter components, robust RESTful APIs, and a clean, modular architecture. This codebase demonstrates expertise in cross-platform mobile development, scalable backend design, and collaborative, maintainable coding practices.
